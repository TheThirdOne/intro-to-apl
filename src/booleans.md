Boolean Operations
==================

What are boolean expressions? In most languages `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `>`, and `<` are the common boolean expressions.

Many languages treat a boolean expression as a True of False value. APL, on the other hand, lacks a boolean type; instead 1 and 0 represent True and False.
