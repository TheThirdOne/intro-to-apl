Keyboard
========

APL was made as an extension/revision of traditional mathmatical notation, and, as a result, has a very special character set that it uses. 

[insert IBM typeball thingy here]

IBM actually made their own [name of the thingy] to print the characters. 

Some of the same challenges that existed during its creation remain to this day. Making a keyboard logically enter the special characters is impossible. However, via entering unicode [number] or by using a custom keyboard that maps modified keys like ctrl-alt-K to a special value.

The keybord / special characters is one of the most controversial decisions for APL as a practial language.[insert arguments for each side]. J is an alternative that uses traditional characters to express the same concepts.
