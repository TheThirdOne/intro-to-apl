Keyboard
========

APL was made as an extension/revision of traditional mathmatical notation, and, as a result, has a very special character set that it uses.

Some of the same challenges that existed during its creation remain to this day. Making a keyboard logically enter the special characters is impossible. However, via entering unicode code point such as `U+223C` or by using a custom keyboard that maps modified keys like ctrl-alt-K to a special value.

The keybord / special characters is one of the most controversial decisions for APL as a practial language.[insert arguments for each side]. J is an dialect that uses traditional characters to express the same concepts.

However, for this book it is recommended fo you to use the onscreen keyboard for the [intepreter](http://ngn.github.io/apl/web).
