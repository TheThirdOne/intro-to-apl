Who this is for

Why learn APL
-------------
  - To learn a new thought process for approaching problems; APL takes a very different approach to problem solving that may help echance your ability to program in other languages
  - Simply because it is a very eccentric language; the shear joy of being able to tell people that you know APL is a fairly good reason.
  - To learn more about mathamtics in a pragmatic fashion.

The pacing you decide to take on this book is entirely up to you.
